       This application's purpose is to make working with with RubyGems.org easier. ðŸ’–
       It uses the RubyGems public API to perform lookups, and parses the JSON response
       body to provide details about the most recent version, as well as links to
       the home page, source code, and changelog.

       Feel free to pass in as many gems that you like, as it makes requests in
       parallel. There is a rate limit, 10/sec. If it detects the amount of gems it
       has been passed is more than the rate limit, the application will run in Batch
       mode, and introduce a one second delay between batch lookups.

       Output Options:
         -h --help            Display the help screen.
         -j --json            Display the raw JSON.
         -v --version         Display version information.
